<p>
      We didn't have CommonJS require in map functions because the
      current CommonJS implementation is scoped to the whole design doc,
      and giving views access to load code from anywhere in the design
      doc would mean we'd have to blow away your view index any time you
      changed anything. Having to rebuild views from scratch just
      because you changed some CSS or a show function isn't fun, so we
      avoided the issue by keeping CommonJS require out of map and
      reduce altogether.
    </p>
<p>
      The solution we came up with is to allow CommonJS inside map and
      reduce funs, but only of libraries that are stored inside the
      views part of the design doc.
    </p>
<p>
      So you could continue to access CommonJS code in design_doc.foo,
      from your list functions etc, but we'd add the ability to require
      CommonJS modules within map and reduce, but only from
      design_doc.views.lib
    </p>
<p>
      There's no worry here about namespace collisions, as Couch just
      plucks <code class="literal">views.*.map</code> and
      <code class="literal">views.*.reduce</code> out of the design doc. So you
      could have a view called <code class="literal">lib</code> if you wanted, and
      still have CommonJS stored in <code class="literal">views.lib.sha1</code>
      and <code class="literal">views.lib.stemmer</code> if you wanted.
    </p>
<p>
      We simplified the implementation by enforcing that CommonJS
      modules to be used in map functions be stored in views.lib.
    </p>
<p>
      A sample design doc (taken from the test suite in Futon) is below:
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">{
   "views" : {
      "lib" : {
         "baz" : "exports.baz = 'bam';",
         "foo" : {
            "zoom" : "exports.zoom = 'yeah';",
            "boom" : "exports.boom = 'ok';",
            "foo" : "exports.foo = 'bar';"
         }
      },
      "commonjs" : {
         "map" : "function(doc) { emit(null, require('views/lib/foo/boom').boom)}"
      }
   },
   "_id" : "_design/test"
}</pre>
<p>
      The <code class="literal">require()</code> statement is relative to the
      design document, but anything loaded form outside of
      <code class="literal">views/lib</code> will fail.
    </p>
