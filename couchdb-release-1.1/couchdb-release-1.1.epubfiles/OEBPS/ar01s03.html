      CouchDB 1.1 supports SSL natively. All your secure connection
      needs can now be served without the need set and maintain a
      separate proxy server that handles SSL.
    </p>
<p>
      SSL setup can be tricky, but the configuration in CouchDB was
      designed to be as easy as possible. All you need is two files; a
      certificate and a private key. If you bought an official SSL
      certificate from a certificate authority, both should be in your
      possession already.
    </p>
<p>
      If you just want to try this out and don't want to pay anything
      upfront, you can create a self-signed certificate. Everything will
      work the same, but clients will get a warning about an insecure
      certificate.
    </p>
<p>
      You will need the OpenSSL command line tool installed. It probably
      already is.
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">shell&gt; <strong class="userinput">
<code>mkdir cert &amp;&amp; cd cert</code>
</strong>
shell&gt; <strong class="userinput">
<code>openssl genrsa &gt; privkey.pem</code>
</strong>
shell&gt; <strong class="userinput">
<code>openssl req -new -x509 -key privkey.pem -out mycert.pem -days 1095</code>
</strong>
shell&gt; <strong class="userinput">
<code>ls</code>
</strong>
mycert.pem privkey.pem</pre>
<p>
      Now, you need to edit CouchDB's configuration, either by editing
      your <code class="filename">local.ini</code> file or using the
      <code class="literal">/_config</code> API calls or the configuration screen
      in Futon. Here is what you need to do in
      <code class="filename">local.ini</code>, you can infer what needs doing in
      the other places.
    </p>
<p>
      Be sure to make these edits. Under <code class="literal">[daemons]</code>
      you should see:
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">; enable SSL support by uncommenting the following line and supply the PEM's below.
; the default ssl port CouchDB listens on is 6984
;httpsd = {couch_httpd, start_link, [https]}</pre>
<p>
      Here uncomment the last line:
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">httpsd = {couch_httpd, start_link, [https]}</pre>
<p>
      Next, under <code class="literal">[ssl]</code> you will see:
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">;cert_file = /full/path/to/server_cert.pem
;key_file = /full/path/to/server_key.pem</pre>
<p>
      Uncomment and adjust the paths so it matches your system's paths:
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">cert_file = /home/jan/cert/mycert.pem
key_file = /home/jan/cert/privkey.pem</pre>
<p>
      For more information please read
      <a class="ulink" href="http://www.openssl.org/docs/HOWTO/certificates.txt">http://www.openssl.org/docs/HOWTO/certificates.txt</a>.
    </p>
<p>
      Now start (or restart) CouchDB. You should be able to connect to
      it using HTTPS on port 6984:
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">shell&gt; <strong class="userinput">
<code>curl https://127.0.0.1:6984/</code>
</strong>
curl: (60) SSL certificate problem, verify that the CA cert is OK. Details:
error:14090086:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE:certificate verify failed
More details here: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html

curl performs SSL certificate verification by default, using a "bundle"
of Certificate Authority (CA) public keys (CA certs). If the default
bundle file isn't adequate, you can specify an alternate file
using the --cacert option.
If this HTTPS server uses a certificate signed by a CA represented in
the bundle, the certificate verification probably failed due to a
problem with the certificate (it might be expired, or the name might
not match the domain name in the URL).
If you'd like to turn off curl's verification of the certificate, use
the -k (or --insecure) option.</pre>
<p>
      Oh no what happened?! &mdash; Remember, clients will notify their
      users that your certificate is self signed.
      <span class="command">
<strong>curl</strong>
</span> is the client in this case and it notifies
      you. Luckily you trust yourself (don't you?) and you can specify
      the <code class="option">-k</code> option as the message reads:
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">shell&gt; <strong class="userinput">
<code>curl -k https://127.0.0.1:6984/</code>
</strong>
{"couchdb":"Welcome","version":"1.1.0"}</pre>
<p>
      All done.
