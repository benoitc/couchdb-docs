<p>
      ETags have been assigned to a map/reduce group (the collection of
      views in a single design document). Any change to any of the
      indexes for those views would generate a new ETag for all view
      URL's in a single design doc, even if that specific view's results
      had not changed.
    </p>
<p>
      In CouchDB 1.1 each <code class="literal">_view</code> URL has it's own ETag
      which only gets updated when changes are made to the database that
      effect that index. If the index for that specific view does not
      change, that view keeps the original ETag head (therefore sending
      back 304 Not Modified more often).
