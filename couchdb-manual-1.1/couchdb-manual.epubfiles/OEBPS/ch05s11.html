      A database purge permanently removes the references to deleted
      documents from the database. Deleting a document within CouchDB
      does not actually remove the documen from the database, instead,
      the document is marked as a deleted (and a new revision is
      created). This is to ensure that deleted documents are replicated
      to other databases as having been deleted. This also means that
      you can check the status of a document and identify that the
      document has been deleted.
    </p>
<p>
      The purge operation removes the refernces to the deleted documents
      from the database. The purging of old documents is not replicated
      to other databases. If you are replicating between databases and
      have deleted a large number of documents you should run purge on
      each database.
    </p>
<div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
<h3 class="title">Note</h3>
<p>
        Purging documents does not remove the space used by them on
        disk. To reclaim disk space, you should run a database compact
        (see <a class="xref" href="ch05s05.html" title="5.5.&nbsp;POST /db/_compact">Section&nbsp;5.5, &ldquo;<code class="literal">POST /db/_compact</code>&rdquo;</a>, and
        compact views (see
        <a class="xref" href="ch05s06.html" title="5.6.&nbsp;POST /db/_compact/design-doc">Section&nbsp;5.6, &ldquo;<code class="literal">POST /db/_compact/design-doc</code>&rdquo;</a>).
      </p>
</div>
<p>
      To perform a purge operation you must send a request including the
      JSON of the document IDs that you want to purge. For example:
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">POST http://couchdb:5984/recipes/_purge
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "FishStew" : [
    "17-b3eb5ac6fbaef4428d712e66483dcb79"
    ]
}</pre>
<p>
      The format of the request must include the document ID and one or
      more revisions that must be purged.
    </p>
<p>
      The response will contain the purge sequence number, and a list of
      the document IDs and revisions successfully purged.
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">{
   "purged" : {
      "FishStew" : [
         "17-b3eb5ac6fbaef4428d712e66483dcb79"
      ]
   },
   "purge_seq" : 11
}</pre>

<p>
        The number of purges on a database is tracked using a purge
        sequence. This is used by the view indexer to optimize the
        updating of views that contain the purged documents.
      </p>
<p>
        When the indexer identifies that the purge sequence on a
        database has changed, it compares the purge sequence of the
        database with that stored in the view index. If the difference
        between the stored sequence and database is sequence is only 1,
        then the indexer uses a cached list of the most recently purged
        documents, and then removes these documents from the index
        individually. This prevents completely rebuilding the index from
        scratch.
      </p>
<p>
        If the difference between the stored sequence number and current
        database sequence is greater than 1, then the view index is
        entirely rebuilt. This is an expensive operation as every
        document in the database must be examined.
